# cryptopals

at long last, working through [the cryptopals challenges](https://www.cryptopals.com/)

also using this as an excuse to learn clojure.

Much to my chagrin, ChatGPT has been extremely useful in learning Clojure: rather than pouring over docs I can quickly discover functions that do what I want. Is this actually good? Maybe so, maybe not, maybe it allows me to stay stuck in my old ways?

## questions/todo

- how to best handle imports? will be writing a lot of pieces that i'll want to reuse. need to figure out classpath manipulation, i think.
    - `lein` was the answer! changed project structure.
